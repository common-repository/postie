Oct 19, 2017 - BCN45:SONOMA CO.: SHERIFF CHALLENGES IMPLICATIONS THAT MAN ARRESTED FOR ARSON COULD HAVE SET DEADLY FIRES

	   
	   
	   BCN45        -ARSON DISPUTE
	   
	   SANTA ROSA (BCN)
	   Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano today challenged implications 
that a Sonoma Valley man who was arrested for arson over the weekend could be 
responsible for some of the fires that have been burning in the North Bay 
since Oct. 8.
	   Giordano responded to a press release issued Wednesday by Thomas 
Homan, the Acting Director of the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement 
about Jesus Fabian Gonzalez.
	   Giordano said the press release was "inaccurate, inflammatory and 
damages the relationship we have with our community."
	   On Sunday, the sheriff's office arrested Gonzalez, 48, for felony 
arson, which occurred at Maxwell Farms Regional Park in the Sonoma Valley 
where Gonzales was sleeping, Giordano said. Deputies recognized Gonzalez who 
told the deputies he lit the fire to keep warm.
	   Gonzalez is being held in the Sonoma County Jail under $100,000 
bail on the arson charge and under $100,000 bail for a misdemeanor drug 
related warrant from Ventura County, Giordano said.
	   He was arraigned Wednesday in jail and his next court date has not 
been set. The Sonoma County Superior Court is closed until Monday because of 
the fires.
	   ICE sent a request on Oct. 16 to detain Gonzalez for 48 hours past 
his scheduled release date from the jail, but the detainer was not signed by 
a judge and the sheriff's office could not legally honor it, Giordano said.
	   ICE spokesman James Schwab said Wednesday ICE filed an 
administrative detainer to hold Gonzalez, but Giordano said administrative 
detainers are considered unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the 
Fourth Amendment.
	   "ICE has the ability to obtain a warrant for anyone they are 
interested in like we do everyday in this county. If ICE obtains a warrant I 
can legally hold the person and would be happy to do so," Giordano said.
	   Gonzalez will remain in the Sonoma County Jail until his arson 
case is adjudicated and Ventura County will then prosecute Gonzalez, Giordano 
said.
	   In his press release, ICE Acting Director Homan said, "Once again, 
a non-cooperative jurisdiction has left their community vulnerable to 
dangerous individuals and preventable crimes."
	   Homan also said ICE lodged detainers against Gonzalez after four 
arrests on felony and misdemeanor charges in Sonoma County, and ICE was never 
notified about Gonzalez's various releases from custody. He also said 
Gonzalez returned to Mexico twice.
	   "The residents of Sonoma County, and the state of California 
deserve better than policies that expose them to avoidable dangers," Homan 
said.
	   "Non-cooperation policies - now enshrined in California state law 
- ensure only one thing: criminals who would otherwise be deported will be 
released and left free to re-offend as they please," Homan said.
	   While Homan did not specifically say Gonzalez is suspected of 
starting any fires in the Bay Area, as reported in some media, he said the 
sheriff's office's action "is especially troubling in light of the massive 
wildfires already devastating the region."
	   Giordano said Cal Fire is investigating the cause of the Tubbs 
Fire, which has caused 23 deaths in Sonoma County, and other fires in the 
North Bay.
	   "There is no indication that Gonzalez had anything to do with 
these fires and it appears highly unlikely," Giordano said.
	   "ICE attacked the Sheriff's Office in the midst of the largest 
natural disaster this county has even experienced," Giordano said in his 
press release.
	   "ICE's misleading statement stirs fear in some of our community 
members who are already exhausted and scared," Giordano said.
	   The Sheriff said he will work with ICE cooperatively and within 
the sheriff's office's policy and the law.
	   "Despite ICE's misleading statement, we will continue to protect 
and serve our community members with the strength and compassion they 
deserve. I hope to end this senseless public confrontation with these facts 
so that I may focus on the fire recovery," Giordano said.
